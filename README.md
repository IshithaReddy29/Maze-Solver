# ðŸ§© Maze Solver in Python

This project is a simple **Maze Solver** implemented in Python using the **Breadth First Search (BFS)** algorithm.  
It finds the shortest path from a start position to a goal position in a user-defined maze.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- User inputs the maze size and grid values.
- Uses **AI BFS algorithm** to find the shortest path.
- Prints the path as a list of coordinates.
- Detects if no path exists.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format
1. Number of rows and columns in the maze.
2. The maze grid (0 = free cell, 1 = wall).
3. Start position (`row col`).
4. Goal position (`row col`).
